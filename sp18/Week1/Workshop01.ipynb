    "\n",
    "[Inspired by Harvey Mudd College's CS5 course] Here's an arithmetic game to try your hand at. Your task is to compute each of the numbers, from 1 through 11, using exactly four 4's and simple math operations. You're allowed to use `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `sqrt()` (square root), `factorial()` (factorial), and `%` (modulus). You're also allowed to use `.4` (that's one 4) or `44` (that's two 4's) if you'd like. Just remember, you must use exactly four 4 digits total!\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, four factorial (denoted by $!$ in mathematics) is $4! = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$, and the modulus operator (usually denoted by $\\text{mod}$ in mathematics) is the remainder after division. For instance, $\\ 5\\ \\text{mod}\\ 2 = 1$, $\\ 13\\ \\text{mod}\\ 7 = 6$, and $\\ 14\\ \\text{mod}\\ 7 = 0$.\n",

    "    from math import factorial, sqrt\n",

Use numpy's `linspace` to make an array for the $x$ values, and use numpy's `exp` and `sin` functions to make arrays for the $y$ values of the two expressions. Make sure the $x$ values are spaced close enough together to make the curves smooth! You can label the axes as simply $x$ and $y$, and add whatever title you'd like. Add some appropriate legend. For instance, `plt.legend(['envelope', 'oscillation'])` would be fine for this workshop."
