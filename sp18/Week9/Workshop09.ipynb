If the particle is charged, this may be achieved by applying a uniform electric field across the infinite well. Since the wavefunction must go to zero at x = 0 and x = L, write it as a Fourier sine series: $\\psi(x) = \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty \\psi_n sin{\\frac{\\pi nx}{L}}$ . Then it can be shown that the vector of Fourier coefficients $\\psi = (\\psi_1,\\psi_2,...)$ satisfies $H\\psi = E\\psi$ where E are the allowed energy eigenvalues, and H is the matrix with elements $H_{mn} = 0$ if m and n are not equal and both even or both odd; $H_{mn} = -\\frac{8amn}{\\pi^2(m^2-n^2)^2}$ if m and n are not equal, and one is even while the other is odd, and finally $H_{mn} = \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{\\hbar^2\\pi^2n^2}{2ML^2}$ if m=n.

In principle, $\\psi$ is an infinite dimensional vector: note that n runs from one to infinity in the Fourier series. This means H, the matrix we want to find the eigenvalues of, is also infinite dimensional. But let's assume the lowest frequency modes dominate the wavefunctions at low energy levels. Then cut n off at ten, so H is a 10x10 matrix. Find the allowed energy levels of the particle (these are just the eigenvalues of H, as explained above)."
